## 🎨 Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means you can use predefined classes to style elements quickly.

* The project is already configured to use **Tailwind CSS**.
* You can modify the `tailwind.config.js` to customize the theme and extend the utility classes if necessary.
* **Responsive** styles are handled using Tailwind's built-in breakpoint classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`).

---

## 🧰 How to Customize the Styles

If you want to customize Tailwind's default settings (colors, fonts, breakpoints, etc.), edit the `tailwind.config.js` file located in the root of the `src` folder. You can extend the default theme or modify it based on your design preferences.
